# knowledge-map


Mindmap of every concept, idea, technique, I had contact with, or interact in some way.
This could represent the concepts I can talk about, with less or more detail and competence.

Notes:
This is not a resource manager. It will only contain the name of the concepts.
Could be interesting to include tools related to those concepts, but I am not so sure about it
Cool options to have: interact with the mindmap on the web, and save different versions of the map on git for every change in the map, maybe?
